Gimbal Interface Example
========================

This is a simple MAVLink to UART interface example for Unix systems that can allow communication between Gremsy's Gimbal and an Onboard computer.

This example will receive one MAVLink message and send one MAVLink message.


Building
========

```
$ cd gSDK/build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Hardware Setup
=========

Connect the COM2 cable to your Onboard Computer.  
The hardware connection between an GIMBAL T3 and a PC or Linux machine. Note that:
The recommended choice of USB to TTL cable is FT232 module.

Refer to: gSDK Documentation

Execution
=========

An FTDI cable will show up on a `ttyUSB*`.
Run the example executable on the host shell:

You have to pick a port name, try searching for it with 
```

$ ls /dev/ttyACM* 
$ ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

Run the example executable on the host shell:

```
$ cd gSDK/
$ ./gSDK -d /dev/ttyUSB0
```

To stop the program, use the key sequence `Ctrl-C`.

Here's an example output:

```

$ ./gSDK -d /dev/ttyUSB0 
OPEN PORT
Connected to /dev/ttyUSB0 with 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
